            "[Score: 0.5000] Content: AWS has an $85B annualized revenue run rate, is still early in its adoption curve, but at a juncture where it’s critical to stay focused on what matters most to customers over the long-haul. Despite growing 29% year-over- year (“YoY”) in 2022 on a $62B revenue base, AWS faces short-term headwinds right now as companies are being more cautious in spending given the challenging, current macroeconomic conditions. While some companies might obsess over how they could extract as much money from customers as possible in these tight times, it’s neither what customers want nor best for customers in the long term, so we’re taking a different tack. One of the many advantages of AWS and cloud computing is that when your business grows, you can seamlessly scale up; and conversely, if your business contracts, you can choose to give us back that capacity and cease paying for it. This elasticity is unique to the cloud, and doesn’t exist when you’ve already made expensive capital investments in your own on-premises datacenters, servers, and networking gear. In AWS, like all our businesses, we’re not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We’re trying to build customer relationships (and a business) that outlast all of us; and as a result, our AWS sales and support teams are spending much of their time helping customers optimize their AWS spend so they can better weather this uncertain economy. Many of these AWS customers tell us that they’re not cost-cutting as much as cost- optimizing so they can take their resources and apply them to emerging and inventive new customer experiences they’re planning. Customers have appreciated this customer-focused, long-term approach, and we think it’ll bode well for both customers and AWS. | Metadata: {'_id': 455, '_collection_name': 'amazon_reports'}\n",

Much of this optimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the cloud more efficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like Graviton chips (our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-performance than other leading x86 processors), S3 Intelligent Tiering (a storage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and store them in less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give customers lower prices in exchange for longer commitments). This work diminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated, and should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimization attenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, and migrations growing again. | Metadata: {'_id': 418, '_collection_name': 'amazon_reports'}\n"

Despite growing 29% year-over- year (“YoY”) in 2022 on a $62B revenue base, AWS faces short-term headwinds right now as companies are being more cautious in spending given the challenging, current macroeconomic conditions. While some companies might obsess over how they could extract as much money from customers as possible in these tight times, it’s neither what customers want nor best for customers in the long term, so we’re taking a different tack. One of the many advantages of AWS and cloud computing is that when your business grows, you can seamlessly scale up; and conversely, if your business contracts, you can choose to give us back that capacity and cease paying for it. This elasticity is unique to the cloud, and doesn’t exist when you’ve already made expensive capital investments in your own on-premises datacenters, servers, and networking gear. In AWS, like all our businesses, we’re not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We’re trying to build customer relationships (and a business) that outlast all of us; and as a result, our AWS sales and support teams are spending much of their time helping customers optimize their AWS spend so they can better weather this uncertain economy. Many of these AWS customers tell us that they’re not cost-cutting as much as cost- optimizing so they can take their resources and apply them to emerging and inventive new customer experiences they’re planning. Customers have appreciated this customer-focused, long-term approach, and we think it’ll bode well for both customers and AWS.'},\n",

However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.\\n\\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\\n\\nIncluded in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing obligations, unearned revenue, asset retirement obligations, tax contingencies, digital video and music content, and deferred tax liabilities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Annual-Report.pdf (Page 36): Net Sales\\n\\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital media content subscriptions.

Much of this optimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the cloud more efficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like Graviton chips (our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-performance than other leading x86 processors), S3 Intelligent Tiering (a storage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and store them in less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give customers lower prices in exchange for longer commitments). This work diminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated, and should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimization attenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, and migrations growing again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuery: Summarize the revenue growth of Amazon AWS in 2023 and the contributing factors..

            "Answer: In 2023, Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a revenue growth of 13% compared to the prior year, reaching $91 billion, up from $80 billion in 2022. This growth was primarily driven by increased customer usage, although it was partially offset by pricing changes linked to long-term customer contracts. Notably, AWS focused on helping customers optimize their cloud usage and reduce costs during uncertain economic conditions, leading to a more efficient use of resources. By the end of 2023, there was a noticeable increase in new deals and larger customer commitments, indicating a positive outlook for continued growth in the AWS segment.\n",

As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. This was followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers, that became our largest revenue event ever.

In the U.S., this result is the combination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network to store items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increased the number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% YoY. As we get items to customers this fast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in various areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing (over 20% YoY in Q4 2023).\n",

            "[Score: 0.5000] Content: AWS has an $85B annualized revenue run rate, is still early in its adoption curve, but at a juncture where it’s critical to stay focused on what matters most to customers over the long-haul. Despite growing 29% year-over- year (“YoY”) in 2022 on a $62B revenue base, AWS faces short-term headwinds right now as companies are being more cautious in spending given the challenging, current macroeconomic conditions. While some companies might obsess over how they could extract as much money from customers as possible in these tight times, it’s neither what customers want nor best for customers in the long term, so we’re taking a different tack. One of the many advantages of AWS and cloud computing is that when your business grows, you can seamlessly scale up; and conversely, if your business contracts, you can choose to give us back that capacity and cease paying for it. This elasticity is unique to the cloud, and doesn’t exist when you’ve already made expensive capital investments in your own on-premises datacenters, servers, and networking gear. In AWS, like all our businesses, we’re not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We’re trying to build customer relationships (and a business) that outlast all of us; and as a result, our AWS sales and support teams are spending much of their time helping customers optimize their AWS spend so they can better weather this uncertain economy. Many of these AWS customers tell us that they’re not cost-cutting as much as cost- optimizing so they can take their resources and apply them to emerging and inventive new customer experiences they’re planning. Customers have appreciated this customer-focused, long-term approach, and we think it’ll bode well for both customers and AWS. | Metadata: {'element_id': '5e85243377386220f895310b7732c0aa', 'filename': 'Amazon-2022-Annual-Report.pdf', 'page_number': 4, 'is_continuation': False, '_id': '76294963-efc1-40e7-a39c-9a47a69de676', '_collection_name': 'Amazon'}\n",

We announced our next generation of generalized CPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30% better compute performance and 75% more memory bandwidth than its already-leading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips, which will deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative AI applications and three times more memory capacity than Trainium1. We continued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint, now offering 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions coming (Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and a second German region in Berlin). In Generative AI (“GenAI”), we added dozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easier for developers to build new Foundation Models (“FMs”). We invented and delivered a new service (Amazon Bedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI applications. And, we launched the most capable coding assistant around in Amazon Q. Customers are excited about these capabilities, and we’re seeing significant traction in our GenAI offerings. (More on how we’re approaching GenAI and why we believe we’ll be successful later in the letter.)\\n\\nWe’re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon long-term. Touching on two of them:\\n\\nWe have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own. This confidence is buoyed by the continued development of compelling, exclusive content (e.g. Thursday Night Football, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, The Boys, Citadel, Road House, etc.), Prime Video customers’ engagement with this content, growth in our marketplace programs (through our third-party Channels program, as well as the broad selection of shows and movies customers rent or buy), and the addition of advertising in Prime Video.')]"

The Climate Pledge brings together the world’s top companies to accelerate joint action, cross-sector collaboration, and responsible change. We are joined by more than 450 Pledge signatories to date. We also continue to invest in innovation through the Climate Pledge Fund, a $2 billion venture investment program supporting the advancement of sustainable technologies and services.\\n\\nWe continue investing in carbon-free energy to lower our emissions. Some of the highlights in this area include:\\n\\n• We were named the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy according to BloombergNEF for the fourth year in a row.\\n\\n• We invested in more than 100 new solar and wind projects in 2023 and now have more than 500 wind and solar projects globally.\\n\\n• We are innovating through new approaches to renewable energy, both directly—including our first brownfield solar project, which will repurpose a previously polluted Maryland coal mine site into a solar farm—and indirectly—including through the Right Now Climate Fund, which supports projects like a first-of-its-kind seaweed farm and a year’s worth of scientific research into carbon reduction through seaweed farming.'), Document(metadata={'element_id': 'b15f39e4763df87c474bef62cd124016', 'filename': 'Note-on-Alignment-with-Paris-Agreement.pdf', 'page_number': 1, 'is_continuation': False, '_id': '2ae9b15e-d1a8-4634-970e-081f7a8d751a', '_collection_name': 'Amazon'}, page_content='Alignment of Our Public Policy Activities with the Paris Agreement Goals\\n\\nWe know we can’t address climate change alone and believe that the public and private sectors must act together to tackle the scale of the climate challenge. In a blog post last April we outlined how public policy is a key lever for climate progress. Amazon has a strong record of supporting policies that advance climate solutions at all levels, and our lobbying and advocacy activities are tightly aligned with the Paris Agreement goals.\\n\\nAmazon’s Direct Efforts to Support the Paris Agreement Goals\\n\\nWe advocate in support of public policy that advances the Paris Agreement by promoting access to and the expansion of clean energy, sustainable transportation, and other decarbonizing solutions. As described in our policy position on climate change:\\n\\nWe believe that human-induced climate change is real, serious, and action is needed from the public and private sectors. Our position regarding climate change is that the overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that human activities are contributing to climate-warming trends over the past century, and most leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements\\n\\nendorsing this position. We agree and have created The Climate Pledge—a commitment to reach the Paris Agreement 10 years early.\\n\\nOur U.S. federal lobbying activities are disclosed quarterly online, consistent with the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995. During 2020, the last full year for which we have reported data, and the first three quarters of 2021, Amazon’s direct lobbying efforts with Congress and the Executive Branch addressed issues related to Amazon’s Climate Pledge, including alternative fuel vehicles, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, sustainable aviation fuels, renewable electricity, federal fleet electrification, renewable energy tax credits, and low-carbon R&D. We also support these policies in many other jurisdictions around the world.')]\n"
